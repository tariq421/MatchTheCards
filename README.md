//A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

  The technologies I've used in this project are simple ones to get the game going and functioned right. A way the user can do something without any errors and somewhere they would be blocked from making the next move. I've created a memory game where they have to match 20 boxes, which will then give them 10 pairs.

  For every click they do it is recorded and shown on the screen so it shows them how well or how bad they did compared to the previous time they played. It is a real good exercise for the brain. I did not make it a competition game. It is a 1 player game. Its basically the player going against himself to see how well he does via the amount of clicks.

  The approach that I took to creating this game was that i first sat and thought of what this game needs and what things I need to implement to the game to make it interesting. I did not rush nor code for the first day. Basically I made an outline of what the game will contain and how the css would look like. I started be doing a wireframe then psuedo coding. Day 2 is where I started to code. My coding was a little bit all over the place but as I went through creating this first game of mine I sought and moved my codes to the right places in the file to have it function the way I visualized it to be functioned.

  The problems I faced were flipping the images and if they match leave/remove them and if they do not match flip them back over. Which I did figure out that I was just missing 1 line of code. The most simplest were the most frustrating. But I guess it will always be that way. I know my game could be better but hey its just the beginning and I will work on it as time goes on every week little by little.

  I had my ups (a few) and my lows (so many) during this first project of mine but it is a beautiful challenge. Sometimes you just sit there and say can I really do this? but I've realized that feeling is a common feeling that just drives you more to doing what you have to to completing the task you are given.
